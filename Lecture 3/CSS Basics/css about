3 ways to add CSS - inline, internal and exteernal

1. inline - styling part is to be done in the line itself
    why we do not prefer the inline css?  -   because of unncessary labour work and changing things individually.
2. internal - styling part for the elements is done within the head of the web page. it uses the "style" tag
    why internal css is not always good? - all the elements of same type will be selected and changed according 
    to the property alloted i.e., we can not provide separate properties for different elements of a single type of tag.
3. external - this is one of the most "practiced" way
    one file externally present contains all the styling.
    used to make code neat and easy to read and make changes to it easily

time comparision
    external takes the most time
        external > internal > inline

priority
    inline > internal > external
